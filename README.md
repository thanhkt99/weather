# weather
I developed this Weather App to learn how to use URLSession with RESTful API. I used Weatherbit API to get needed data. 
In addition, I used some packages that support animated UI such as Lottie, ViewAnimator and Core Animations of Swift. 

## Technology:
- Swift
- URLSession
- RESTful API
- Core Animation
- XIB, Storyboard
- SPM (Swift Package Manager)
## Library
- Then
- Lottie
